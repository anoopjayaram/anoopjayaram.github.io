      <h2>Does RPA kill Jobs?</h2>
      <h5>Overview  of Robotic Process Automation, Jan 7, 2022</h5>
      <div class="rpa" style="height:200px;"></div>
      <h3>RPA?</h3>
      <p>
        Robotic Process Automation, it is not like a Humanoid robot do all the tasks as seen in the movies! 
        Robotic, a program that imitates the human actions. 
        A Process is a work flow or sequence of steps that’s lead to an activity or a function.
         Automation is any process that is done by a robot without human intervention.  It’s a tool or software robot that do task without human intervention.
        You may wonder when you login to a portal, there is a question like Are you a robot?  </p>
        <p>
        In some websites , they ask to type some words or numbers inside a box or images names as CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Human Apart). It is implemented to block spammers and software bots that are try to automatically create email accounts, sign up automatically, access databases etc. </p>
        <p> main objective of the CAPTCHA is to make sure the resource is accessing by the human, not a bot. The updation of CAPTCHA, reCAPTCHA ensures more security towards bots. This test is almost impossible to solve by the software robots. 
        It’s about automating the manual jobs as repetitive task based on a pattern like combining the spreadsheet documents from different sources to a single one, scrapping (collecting) data from online resources, bank tellers, etc.
        As part of industrial automation, many labours were replaced by machines. The same issues arrived in history before when the computer was introduced. Introducing technology doesn’t make peoples jobless. It creates new opportunities and time to skill up.
        </p>
        <h3>Working</h3>
        <p>
            The RPA tools have the ability to imitate the user action, especially repetitive tasks. We have to set the steps or work flow using RPA tool. Once the pattern is created, it will work continuously without any mistakes till the project is cancelled.
            The tools like Blue Prism, Ui Path, Automation Anywhere etc are used by many companies as well as developers. Some of these tools have free or trial versions. We can learn the basics and implement it.
        </p>
        <h3>Application</h3>
        <p>
            <li> &nbsp;&nbsp; Data Entry</li>
            <li> &nbsp;&nbsp; Report Generation</li>
            <li> &nbsp;&nbsp; Data Extraction</li>
            <li> &nbsp;&nbsp; Invoice Processing</li>
            <li> &nbsp;&nbsp; E Mail Automation</li>   
        </p>
        <h3>Future</h3>
        <p> According to Forrester, the RPA industry will grow from 250 million Dollar in 2016 to 2.9 billion Dollar in 2021. The requirement of RPA increased rapidly and this creates a shortage in developers.
            This creates the opportunities in this technology.</p>
         <p>Using RPA tools can replace clerical jobs and leads to increase in speed and accuracy. This helps to cut the expenses and save time for firms.
            Many firms already implemented the RPA to work in their business.
            The investments for this technology have drastically increased. During pandemic time 2020-2021, the requirement of RPA become increased. One of the applications of RPA used is for automating the clinical testing for a vaccine and documentation, which is a repetitive task. It become easy by using the RPA tool. </p>
